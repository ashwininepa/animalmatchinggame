This is my first C# assignment from the book 'Head first C#' by Andrew and Jennifer.

Even though the book asks to use Visual Studio, I am using VS Code as I have everything set up there. The book is fun to experiment with and for a beginner like me. 

I am also doing C# course from Microsoft which is helping me with console C# and this project uses WPF C# which is from the book.

Looking forward to create more such good things by me.

Best,
Ashwini
